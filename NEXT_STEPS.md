# 📋 DataZen - Next Steps & Action Plan

**Current Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Overall Progress**: 75% Complete  
**Time to Full Deployment**: ~2-3 hours (excluding DNS propagation)

---

## 🎯 Why Your Website Shows 404

### The Issue
When you visit `https://www.versan.in`, you see a 404 error.

### The Reason
**DNS Propagation is in progress!**

Your domain nameservers were just changed from Hostinger to Vercel's nameservers. This change takes time to propagate globally:
- **Typical time**: 1-24 hours
- **Maximum time**: 48 hours
- **Current status**: Propagating

### Temporary Solution
**Use the Vercel URL directly:**
```
https://datazen-saas-42hvu5tey-pranaos-projects.vercel.app
```

### Check DNS Status
Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net/?domain=versan.in

Once all nameservers show Vercel's DNS, your site will be live at versan.in!
