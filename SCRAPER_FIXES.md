# Web Scraper Issues and Fixes

## Problems Identified

### 1. **LinkedIn Blocking (Critical Issue)**
**Problem:** LinkedIn actively blocks automated scrapers and requires authentication. The scraper cannot access LinkedIn content because:
- LinkedIn detects bot traffic and returns 403 Forbidden
- LinkedIn requires JavaScript rendering and authentication
- LinkedIn's HTML structure is heavily obfuscated and dynamically loaded

**Why it fails:**
- Simple HTTP requests are immediately blocked
- Even with Playwright, LinkedIn detects automation and blocks access
- LinkedIn's Terms of Service prohibit scraping

**Solution:** 
- Added comprehensive anti-bot detection headers
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added proper User-Agent and security headers
- Note: LinkedIn scraping requires authentication or API access (not recommended)

### 2. **University Websites Not Detected**
**Problem:** University websites were not being detected as a special category, so they were treated as generic websites.

**Solution:**
- Added university website detection in `detect_website_type()` method
- Detects `.edu` domains and keywords like 'university', 'college', 'school', 'academic'
- Created specialized `extract_university_data()` method to extract:
  - Institution name
  - Programs and departments
  - Contact information
  - News and events

### 3. **Insufficient Anti-Bot Headers**
**Problem:** The scraper was using minimal headers, making it easy for websites to detect and block bot traffic.

**Solution:**
- Updated headers in all scrapers (Playwright, FallbackScraper, EnhancedScraper)
- Added comprehensive security headers:
  - `Sec-Fetch-*` headers (indicate legitimate browser requests)
  - `Sec-Ch-Ua*` headers (Chrome/Edge user agent hints)
  - Proper `Accept-Encoding` and `Cache-Control`
  - Realistic `User-Agent` string

### 4. **No Retry Logic**
**Problem:** If a request failed, the scraper would immediately give up, especially on rate-limited (429) or forbidden (403) responses.

**Solution:**
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handles specific HTTP status codes:
  - 429 (Too Many Requests): Retry with increasing delays
  - 403 (Forbidden): Retry with delay (may indicate anti-bot)
  - Timeout/Connection errors: Retry with delay
- Maximum 3 retry attempts with configurable delays

### 5. **Missing Error Handling for Anti-Bot Detection**
**Problem:** No specific handling for anti-bot responses, making debugging difficult.

**Solution:**
- Added specific error messages for different failure types
- Logs indicate whether failure is due to rate limiting, access denial, or connection issues
- Better error reporting to help identify the root cause

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/services/enhanced_scraper.py`
- Enhanced `__init__()` with comprehensive headers and retry configuration
- Added `fetch_page_content()` method with retry logic and anti-bot handling
- Updated `detect_website_type()` to recognize university websites
- Added `extract_university_data()` method for educational websites
- Updated `scrape()` method to handle university websites

### 2. `backend/services/fallback_scraper.py`
- Enhanced `__init__()` with comprehensive headers
- Updated `fetch_page_content()` with retry logic and anti-bot handling
- Added proper error handling for rate limiting and access denial

### 3. `backend/services/scraper.py`
- Updated Playwright headers with comprehensive anti-bot detection headers
- Better User-Agent and security headers

## Important Limitations

### LinkedIn Scraping
**Cannot be fixed without authentication:**
- LinkedIn explicitly prohibits automated scraping in their Terms of Service
- LinkedIn uses sophisticated anti-bot detection
- LinkedIn requires login and authentication
- Recommended: Use LinkedIn API (requires approval) or manual data collection

### Protected Websites
Some websites use:
- JavaScript rendering (requires Playwright, which is already implemented)
- CAPTCHA (cannot be bypassed without solving service)
- IP-based rate limiting (requires proxy rotation)
- Session-based authentication (requires login credentials)

## Testing the Fixes

### Test University Website
```python
# Test with a university website
url = "https://www.mit.edu"
result = scraper.scrape(url, data_type='text')
```

### Test Retry Logic
The scraper will now:
1. Attempt to fetch the page
2. If rate-limited (429), wait and retry
3. If forbidden (403), wait and retry
4. If timeout, wait and retry
5. After 3 attempts, return error

### Monitor Logs
Check logs for messages like:
- "Rate limited (429) on attempt X"
- "Access forbidden (403) - may be blocked by anti-bot"
- "Successfully fetched URL"

## Recommendations

1. **For LinkedIn:** Use official LinkedIn API or consider alternative data sources
2. **For Protected Sites:** Implement proxy rotation if needed
3. **For Rate Limiting:** Add delays between requests
4. **For JavaScript Sites:** Playwright is already configured for this
5. **For CAPTCHA:** Consider using a CAPTCHA solving service

## Configuration

Environment variables can be set to customize behavior:
- `SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Request timeout (default: 120)
- `MAX_HTML_SIZE_MB`: Maximum HTML size to process (default: 2)

## Future Improvements

1. Add proxy rotation support
2. Implement CAPTCHA solving integration
3. Add session management for authenticated scraping
4. Implement JavaScript rendering for more complex sites
5. Add rate limiting awareness and adaptive delays
