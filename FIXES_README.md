# Web Scraper Fixes - Complete Guide

## Overview

This document describes the fixes applied to the web scraper to address issues with scraping LinkedIn and university websites.

## Quick Summary

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| LinkedIn scraping fails | ⚠️ Cannot fix | Use LinkedIn API or alternatives |
| University websites not detected | ✅ FIXED | Added university detection |
| Insufficient anti-bot headers | ✅ FIXED | Enhanced headers added |
| No retry logic | ✅ FIXED | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Poor error handling | ✅ FIXED | Specific error messages |

## What Was Fixed

### 1. University Website Support ✅
**Problem**: University websites were treated as generic sites
**Solution**: 
- Detects `.edu` domains and keywords
- Extracts institution name, programs, contact info, news/events
- Specialized parsing for educational content

**Test Results**:
- MIT: 26 items extracted ✅
- Stanford: 147 items extracted ✅

### 2. Anti-Bot Detection Evasion ✅
**Problem**: Minimal headers made scraper easily detectable
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive security headers
- Realistic User-Agent string
- Proper Accept-Encoding and Cache-Control
- Sec-Fetch-* headers for browser legitimacy

**Impact**: Better compatibility with modern websites

### 3. Retry Logic ✅
**Problem**: Single attempt, no handling for temporary failures
**Solution**:
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Specific handling for HTTP 429 (rate limited)
- Specific handling for HTTP 403 (forbidden)
- Configurable delays

**Example**:
```
Attempt 1: Fails with 429
Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 2: Fails with 429
Wait 4 seconds
Attempt 3: Succeeds
```

### 4. Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Generic error messages, hard to debug
**Solution**:
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Detailed logging
- Clear indication of root cause

**Examples**:
- "Rate limited after retries"
- "Access forbidden - website may block scrapers"
- "Connection error"

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/services/enhanced_scraper.py`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced `__init__()` with comprehensive headers
- Added `fetch_page_content()` with retry logic
- Updated `detect_website_type()` for universities
- Added `extract_university_data()` method
- Updated `scrape()` to handle universities

**Lines Changed**: ~200 lines added/modified

### 2. `backend/services/fallback_scraper.py`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced `__init__()` with comprehensive headers
- Updated `fetch_page_content()` with retry logic
- Added error handling for rate limiting

**Lines Changed**: ~70 lines added/modified

### 3. `backend/services/scraper.py`
**Changes**:
- Updated Playwright headers with anti-bot detection
- Better User-Agent and security headers

**Lines Changed**: ~20 lines modified

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
cd backend
python test_fixes.py
```

### Expected Output
```
✅ MIT University: 26 items extracted
✅ Stanford University: 147 items extracted
✅ HTTPBin: 2 items extracted
✅ Example.com: 2 items extracted
✅ Fallback Scraper: 3-5 items extracted
```

## Usage Examples

### Scrape University Website
```python
from services.enhanced_scraper import EnhancedScraper

scraper = EnhancedScraper()
result = scraper.scrape('https://www.mit.edu', data_type='text')

if result['success']:
    print(f"Found {result['count']} items")
    print(f"Website type: {result['website_type']}")
    for item in result['data']:
        print(f"- {item['text']}")
```

### With Retry Logic
```python
# Automatically retries up to 3 times with backoff
# Handles rate limiting (429) and access denial (403)
result = scraper.scrape('https://example.com')
```

### Fallback Scraper
```python
from services.fallback_scraper import FallbackScraper

scraper = FallbackScraper()
result = scraper.extract_text('https://example.com')
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Request timeout in seconds (default: 120)
SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120

# Maximum HTML size in MB (default: 2)
MAX_HTML_SIZE_MB=2
```

### Programmatic Configuration
```python
scraper = EnhancedScraper(
    timeout=120,           # seconds
    max_html_size_mb=2     # MB
)
```

## Limitations

### LinkedIn
- **Cannot be scraped** due to explicit anti-scraping measures
- Requires authentication
- See `LINKEDIN_ALTERNATIVES.md` for solutions

### Protected Websites
- CAPTCHA: Requires solving service
- IP-based rate limiting: Requires proxy rotation
- Session authentication: Requires credentials

## Performance Metrics

### Before Fixes
- Anti-bot detection: Minimal
- Retry attempts: 0
- University support: No
- Error clarity: Low

### After Fixes
- Anti-bot detection: Comprehensive
- Retry attempts: 3 with backoff
- University support: Yes
- Error clarity: High

## Troubleshooting

### "Rate limited (429)"
- Website is rate limiting requests
- Scraper will retry automatically
- Consider adding delays between requests

### "Access forbidden (403)"
- Website detected bot traffic
- Scraper will retry with delay
- May need proxy rotation for high-volume scraping

### "Connection error"
- Network issue or timeout
- Scraper will retry automatically
- Check internet connection

### "Website type: general"
- Website not recognized as special type
- Falls back to general extraction
- Still extracts content successfully

## Logging

### Enable Debug Logging
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Log Output Examples
```
INFO:services.enhanced_scraper:Fetching https://www.mit.edu (attempt 1/3)
INFO:services.enhanced_scraper:Detected website type: university for https://www.mit.edu
INFO:services.enhanced_scraper:Successfully scraped 26 items from https://www.mit.edu
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add proxy rotation support
2. Implement CAPTCHA solving
3. Add session management
4. Implement rate limiting awareness
5. Add JavaScript rendering for complex sites

### For LinkedIn
- Use official LinkedIn API
- See `LINKEDIN_ALTERNATIVES.md` for details

## Support

### Documentation Files
- `SCRAPER_FIXES.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md` - Investigation results
- `LINKEDIN_ALTERNATIVES.md` - LinkedIn alternatives
- `FIXES_README.md` - This file

### Testing
- `backend/test_fixes.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Conclusion

The scraper has been significantly improved with better anti-bot detection evasion, robust retry logic, and university website support. However, LinkedIn scraping remains impossible without authentication due to their explicit anti-scraping measures.

For questions or issues, refer to the documentation files or review the test results.
