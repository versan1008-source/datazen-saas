## 💡 Key Points

1. **Dockerfile is correct** - Uses Python 3.11, installs dependencies, copies backend code
2. **render.yaml is correct** - Configured to use Docker runtime
3. **Health endpoint exists** - Backend has `/health` endpoint that returns 200 OK
4. **All dependencies included** - requirements.txt has all needed packages
5. **CORS configured** - Backend allows requests from Vercel frontend
6. **Environment variables ready** - All needed vars configured in Render

---

## 🆘 If Render Deployment Fails

**Check these things:**
1. Render dashboard logs for error messages
2. Verify Dockerfile syntax is correct
3. Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt
4. Verify PORT environment variable is set
5. Check if backend code has any syntax errors

**Common issues:**
- Missing dependencies → Add to requirements.txt
- Port not exposed → Already in Dockerfile
- Working directory wrong → Already set to /app
- Python version incompatible → Using 3.11 which is stable
